This project represents monomial, polynomial with many functions and operations

### **Monom class**

Use a monom from the format of ax^b. **(a must be a (double) number**

**And b must be every (integer)number greater and equal to 0)**

   Note: We assumed that the input is valid

   ax^b

The class monom supports some functions as

- add=\&gt;adding two monoms if they have the same power
- derivative: computing the derivative of a monom
- f(x): compute the monom in a given number
- multiply: multiple between our monom and giving monom
- is equal: checks if the two monom have the same coeff and power
- is zero:checks if the coeff is zero(the monom is zero)

### **Polynom class**

Use a ploynom from the format of a_x1^b + a_x2^b + .... + axn^b. **(a must be a (double) number**

**And b must be every (integer)number greater and equal to 0)**

   Note: We assumed that the input is valid

   ax1^b + ax2^b + .... + axn^b

   polynom (string):every input is valid(ax^b) without &quot;\*&quot;

The class polynom supports some functions as:

- add - there is two options to add function add Monom/Polynom(using Polynom\_able) ,the monom function adds monom to our polynom and the polynom function adds polynom to our polynom.
- Derivative: compute the derivative of the polynom without changing the current polynom(it puts the derivative in a new polynom)
- f(x): computes the polynom in a given number
- multiply: multiples two polynoms
- subtract: subtracts two polynoms
- root
- area: computing the area of the polynom in a giving eps
- is equal: checks if two polynoms are equal
- is zero: checks if every coeff of the monoms in the polynom are 0
- polynom(string): every input is valid (ax^b) without &quot;\*&quot;

### **Example run**

### To show the polynom graph you must type &quot;Graph &#39;name&#39;=new Graph(put your polynom name,from(double x1),to (double x2);

&#39;name&#39;=setVisible(true);&quot; 

### Example: &quot;Graph &#39;name&#39;=new Graph(p,-5,5);

&#39;name&#39;=setVisible(true);&quot;
